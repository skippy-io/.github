Skippy is designed for the modern pace of software development, where Continuous Integration (CI) should be a boon, not
a burden. Unlike traditional CI tools that run all tests regardless of necessity, Skippy's intelligent test impact
analysis cuts down on unnecessary testing and flakiness, slashing build times to improve developer productivity and happiness.

Utilizing static & dynamic bytecode analysis, Skippy lets you iterate faster without compromising the integrity 
of your builds. It’s about working smarter, not harder—let Skippy streamline your builds, so you can get back to what CI was 
meant to be: a fast track to production.
